This code implements a three-class neural network using the EBPTA_3M algorithm for non-linear classification. Users input three points per class interactively, which are augmented with a bias term to form the training set. The network has an input layer, a six-neuron hidden layer, and three output neurons. During training, hidden and output layer activations are computed, errors are calculated, and weights are updated iteratively until the error falls below a threshold or the maximum iterations are reached. Finally, the code visualizes the original points, the hidden layer transformation, decision boundaries, and the convergence of the error over iterations.
